# power-bi-sales-dashboard
I recently developed a Power BI dashboard to analyze key sales metrics and deliver meaningful business insights.

This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of:

Top 3 best-selling products

Total sales and total profit

Sales performance by country and by year

Revenue by product line

Average shipping days

The project involved end-to-end work, including data cleaning, data modeling, and visual design to ensure clarity and usability. I also worked in Excel during the early data preparation stages before building the final solution in Power BI.
